# Project 2: Information Plan for NLP Tutorial Creation
## Purpose statement 
This project prepares an information plan on behalf of Temple University’s Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio, which will guide the creation of tutorials for the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with these software: spaCy, Colab, and Github. They will be aimed mainly at students, faculty and staff at Temple University and in general, novices to the practice of using natural language processing.
## Purpose of documentation
This plan presents:
-	An explanation of how we gathered our data
-	A description of the product
-	An example profile of potential users
-	User’s goals, needs, and struggles when using the product
-	An analysis comparing tutorials of similar software to the product
-	Recommendations of how to address user’s needs
The documentation and tutorial are aimed at guiding new users through learning how to use natural language processing. 
## Usability Goals
Our data was gathered through observing and interviewing some first-time Temple student users of spaCy in the classroom. We used **think-aloud protocol testing** and were able to track the users’ thought processes while using the software. This raw data was analyzed for trends in regards to frustrations, common errors made, as well as what the users perceived as facilitating their learning. These trends are reinterpreted into solvable problems which our recommendations at the end of this documentation will address. 
## Product Description
*SpaCy* is an extensive, open-source modern library for Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is in short, the computer’s ability to process and parse the written and spoken human language. SpaCy is written in Python, but can load spaCy models in several different programming languages. It has several functions that can be used to build applications to process large texts; examples of a few NLP functions are tokenization, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and Named Entity Recognition (NER). Ultimately spaCy can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems, or to pre-process text for deep learning. 

*Colab,* a product of Google Research, is a virtual notebook environment that allows a user to execute Python code from their browser. It does not require any set-up, running entirely on the digital cloud, and files created through Colab can be copied, downloaded, and shared. It is naturally integrated with Google Drive, the digital storage space. 

*Github* is a platform for collaborative work on code projects, stored in repositories. It allows for many versions of a file to be saved and tracked through the edits, through its branching function, then merged into the official, main version. 
## Audience Profile
Target audience is comprised of Temple University students, staff, and faculty, especially the students. This means age, gender, and life experiences will vary widely, but students will **most likely be in the 20s range** and have a young adult’s **familiarity with navigating basic web browsers, word-processers, and digital storage sites.** 

Regardless, the majority are anticipated to have **little to no experience with natural language processing and programming,** and that these users are expected to need to use NLP over the course of their school years for coursework. Tutorials should approach with the mind that all terms, processes, and direction even that which is related to coding in general and not only spaCy, will be unfamiliar to the audience. In case some parts feel counterintuitive to the novice user, the tutorials need to provide adequate explanation for each part. 

The tutorials are expected to be **distributed by Temple University’s Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio.** According to their “About” page, the Studio “offers spaces and resources for student and faculty consultations, workshops, and collaborative research in digital humanities, digital arts, cultural analytics, and critical making.” They have physical computer labs in which people can gather and be taught and advised directly. Alternatively, the tutorials will be in a **digital format** that can be accessed from any virtual environment. 

Our research has indicated that in general, first-time users experience frustration from being overwhelmed by information, or confused by the lack of familiarity with spaCy. With proper explanation they may understand what individually, one part of the code may do, but struggle to put them together to successfully create the intended application. Related to that, they struggle to construct applications because of the need for exact and proper syntax. 
## Competitive Review
### Machine Learning Plus:
-	Strengths: 
    - Offers definitions for some basic NLP terms. 
    - Has a table of contents with anchor links to relevant parts
    - The examples of code cells have examples of how the code should return once executed
-	Weaknesses:
    - Does not offer many definitions for coding-related terms
    - No direction for how to format/use the code, only what a certain chunk of code should do and what they’re used for.
-	Opportunities:
    - Could offer a help bot
-	Threats:
    - Subject to upkeep of hosting website
### Spacy.io 101
-	Strengths: 
    - Explains what spaCy is and its purpose
    - Gives basic idea of what spaCy can’t do and is not designed to accomplish
    - Has a table of contents with anchor links to relevant parts in the sidebar
    - Has visuals and graphics
    - Has little Q-and-A’s
    - Provides tips for understanding the code to the side
    - Offers definitions for basic NLP terms
    - Has an example code cell for each section with the relevant code pre-written and can be edited/fiddled with and run by the reader
-	Weaknesses:
    - Does not offer many definitions for coding-related terms (ex: string)
-	Opportunities:
    - Hyperlinks to other resources related
-	Threats:
    - Subject to upkeep of hosting website

### Programming Historian:
-	Strengths: 
    - Substantial index of guides
    - Organized and mostly intuitive search function
    - Shares whether the content is peer-reviewed or not, skill level for the content discussed, and who wrote it
-	Weaknesses:
    - Occasionally code cell examples
    - Rarely content comes with visuals
    - Is not specific to spaCy
-	Opportunities:
    - Hyperlinks to other resources explaining some terms
-	Threats:
    - Subject to upkeep of hosting website

## Design Implications
Here are our recommendations based on our research and analyses of competitors: 
-	Provide an index and/or introductory section which explains basic programming terms and spaCy-specific terms. 
    - The index should be instantly reachable with hyperlinks or anchor links
-	Instructions should be explicit and clear
-	Provide graphics and visuals to facilitate understanding
-	Provide multiple examples of what’s being taught and what should be returned upon running it, so the user can see what variable and/or entity is being altered and how it affects the output
-	Let the examples be shown with each step, so the user can see what each step is asking for
-	Provide practice problems at the end with most of the code given but obvious blanks to fill out; users should be able to identify what entity needs to be altered or added based on the instructions and examples provided earlier
-	Exact punctuation and syntax of each code should be explicitly explained
-	Separate tutorials for each function and/or concept
    - Make it so they can be learned in a specific order
    - OR add links to related tutorials to functions and/or concepts will need to be understood as a prerequisite to learning this concept 
## Challenges
The creators of the tutorials may be constrained by their **inability to add deeper interactivity** with the student, such as the code cells that can be run from the tutorial page itself, as SpaCy.io 101 does, (although visuals can be provided in place of them). The creators may be hampered by our **limited audience sample,** as we interviewed and observed primarily the students of a single classroom from a single course, thereby making our data at risk of being biased. The creators of the tutorials may have to consider whether tutorial for each function **can be accessed and understood independently.**
