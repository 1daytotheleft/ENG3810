## What is an official transcript?
An official transcript is your certified academic record.  An official transcript displays 
1. the terms you attended
2. graded courses, academic program
3.  and other relevant academic information. 

Current students, former students and alumni can place an order for an official paper transcript or an electronic transcript (eTranscript).

## Unofficial transcript:

I've made the headings clear and bolded certain text that is important. I separated the text chunks to make it easier to read.
